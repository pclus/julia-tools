# Julia tools

Short and easy to use julia code examples on different topics.

+ `power_spectra.jl` Demonstration on how to use the [`FFTW`](https://juliamath.github.io/FFTW.jl/stable/) and [`Multitaper`](https://docs.juliahub.com/Multitaper/OT9LO/0.2.0/) packages to compute the spectra of oscillatory signals.
